## Description

This is a Social Media application built by an author for authors. I wanted a place where authors could come together and make very focused discussion posts and friend groups based around writing styles and genres.

## Installation

This application cannot be installed as it is not a front-end application. Feel free to branch the existing code and add some content if you would like.

## Usage

Currently this application is in development and thus cannot be used. However if you start the repo and check back regularly more may come soon.
